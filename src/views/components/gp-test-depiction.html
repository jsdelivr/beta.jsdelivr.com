					What is ping?
				</span>

				<p class="c-gp-test-depiction_test_descr">
					Ping is a network testing and troubleshooting utility that helps identify problems when
					you can't reach a server or experience slow loading times. It's also often used for simple
					network performance monitoring, determining if a website is reachable from the local network, or resolving a hostname's IP address.
				</p>

				<p class="c-gp-test-depiction_test_descr">
					Ping sends Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets from your location to a target
					host (a hostname or IP address) to test connectivity. If everything goes well, the target
					receives the request and sends back a response to confirm that it's reachable and working.
					The response includes the round-trip time (RTT), which tells you how long it took for the
					data to travel to the destination and back. This RTT can also indicate the latency, or delay, to the target.

				<span class="c-gp-test-depiction_test_header">
					What is traceroute?
				</span>

				<p class="c-gp-test-depiction_test_descr">
					Traceroute is a valuable network testing and troubleshooting utility that helps pinpoint potential issues along
					the route between your device and the target host, such as when you're unable to reach a website or experience slow load times.
				</p>

				<p class="c-gp-test-depiction_test_descr">
					Traceroute sends small data packets to a target hostname or IP address and lists each hop (usually a router) used to get there.
					Each packet has a Time to Live (TTL) value, starting at 1, to limit its lifespan. As the data passes through each hop, the TTL
					value decreases by 1. Once it reaches 0, the current router stops forwarding the packet and responds with a "TTL exceeded" message.
					Traceroute then takes note of the router's IP address, increases the packet's initial TTL by 1, and resends the request.
					Thanks to this back and forth, traceroute can compile a list of all the hops the data passes to the target, including the
					round-trip time (RTT) for each hop.
				</p>

				<span class="c-gp-test-depiction_test_header">
					What are common use cases for traceroute?
				</span>
				<p class="c-gp-test-depiction_test_descr">
					Are you wondering what you can actually achieve by running traceroute? Here're some typical use cases:
				</p>

				<span class="c-gp-test-depiction_test_subheader">
					Measure performance
				</span>
				<p class="c-gp-test-depiction_test_descr">
					If you notice high latency to a target, run traceroute and look at each hop's round-trip time (RTT) to learn about the time it
					took for the data packets to reach the destination and back. If you come across a hop with an unusually high RTT, it could
					indicate congestion or some other performance issue at that point.
				</p>

				<span class="c-gp-test-depiction_test_subheader">
					Analyze network paths
				</span>
				<p class="c-gp-test-depiction_test_descr">
					Traceroute comes in handy when you need to know the path packets take through the network to reach a target host. Listing
					the IP addresses, host names, and RTTs for each hop gives you a clearer picture of the network infrastructure. As a result,
					you may find potential bottlenecks or other problematic segments, allowing you to take action quickly.
				</p>

				<span class="c-gp-test-depiction_test_subheader">
					Troubleshoot network connectivity
				</span>
				<p class="c-gp-test-depiction_test_descr">
					When you're experiencing network connectivity issues, traceroute can help pinpoint the problem by collecting data about
					each hop between your device and the target. Typically, the issue is with the last hop that sent a response or the one after
					that hop. Once you know where the problem is, you're a big step closer to solving it.
				</p>

				<span class="c-gp-test-depiction_test_subheader">
					Verify routing changes
				</span>
				<p class="c-gp-test-depiction_test_descr">
