					jsDelivr is a public, open-source CDN (Content Delivery Network) developed by <a href="https://dakulov.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dmitriy Akulov</a> and <a href="https://prospectone.io" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Prospect One</a>,
					focused on performance, reliability, and security. It is free to use for everyone, with no bandwidth limits.

				<h2>Security</h2>

				<p>
					We are focused on production use, which also means we are very serious about security.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>All jsDelivr services support HTTPS.</li>
					<li>All jsDelivr related accounts are protected by strong passwords, 2FA, and IP whitelists where possible.</li>
					<li>Our critical code has been thoroughly reviewed both by us and several other independent experts.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					We also have protections in place to prevent people from using jsDelivr to serve malicious files,
					but if you find something that doesn't look right,
					<a href="https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/issues/new?title=Malicious file" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report it at our issue tracker</a>.
